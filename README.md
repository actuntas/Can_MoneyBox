## Requirements

Xcode 13.3.1  <br />
iOS13+

## Design Pattern

MVVM design pattern was preferred to make the project more readable, testable and maintainable.

Coordinator pattern was preffered to decouple navigation logic from ViewControllers.

## Dependencies

SPM is used as Dependency Manager. <br />
Only `IQKeyboardManagerSwift` is used in the project as a 3rd party dependency to handle keyboard layout and toolbar.
