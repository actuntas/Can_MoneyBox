## Requirements

Xcode 13.3.1  <br />
iOS13+

## Design Pattern

MVVM design pattern was preferred to make the project more readable, testable and maintainable.


## Dependencies
SPM is used as Dependency Manager. <br />
Only `IQKeyboardManagerSwift` is used in the project as a 3rd party dependency to handle keyboard layout and toolbar.

## Notes

* It was really a long week. Thank you for your patience.

* I have very similar two ViewModels (accounts and accountdetails viewmodels) If I have more time that's the downside I need to recover.

* I am aware of Keychain read never used inside the project and I haven't handled error scenarios on KeychainManager that's another downside that I need to fix.

* Regardless of this project succeeds or not feedbacks are always welcome <3
